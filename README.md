# saySomething

Do you want to say something, but not really? Just write it in here and see it pop up.



## What I want to do:

### First of all
- Take the input.
- Limit input's length and maybe add a small counter which colour will be whiter the closer the remaining characters get close to zero.
- Push it to an array1.
- Empty the input.
- BONUS: Move the S up while making it smaller.

### Displaying the stuff
- BONUS: Wait untill the user enters something to start the display.
- Get the array1.length.
- Get a random_number between 0 and the array1.length-1.
- Display the item on array1[random_number] in a random place of the screen.
- Take the item array1[random_number] out of the array1 and push it to array2.
- If array1.length is 0, repeat using array2.
- Make sure that when introducing the new input, it doesn't switch from array2 to array1 because array1.length is bigger than 0.
